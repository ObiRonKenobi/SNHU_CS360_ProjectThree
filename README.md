Mobile Architecture and Programming


~ Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  This app addressed the needs of employees in a warehouse who need to keep track of certain items in stock.

~ What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  An authentication screen was necessary to ensure the data was secure and trustworthy. An inventory screen was necessary to display and facilitate adding/removing items from the inventory. An SMS screen was necessary to allow employees to opt in for inventory-based notifications.

~ How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  I started by considering user requirements and what would be functionally necessary to facilitate these goals. Then I developed the layout for the user interface so that employees could easily access and implement the data they need. Finally, I developed backend code to control the data set to the user interface. This incremental process can be applied to a variety of future projects.

~ How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  I tested my code reiteratively and incrementally as well. By building one small part of the functionality at a time and testing it before moving on to another piece, I was able to reveal and address a number of flaws before they became even more time-consuming.

~ Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  This project was challenging from beginning to end. It is hard to pick a specific instance when innovation was used to overcome a challenge. In away completing this project at all was overcoming a challenge

~ In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  I'm particularly pleased with the way the  UI layout came out
